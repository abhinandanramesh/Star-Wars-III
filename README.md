Star-Wars-III
=============

A remake of the trench sequence of star wars (level III), a vintage arcade game. A fun coding weekend at PESIT with the juniors.

The code runs perfectly fine in the CodeSkulptor development environment. The IDE can be found here. (http://www.codeskulptor.org/)

The rules go like on similar grounds to the level 3 star wars sequence game.

The Death Star can be destroyed about once every three attempts, but the code can be edited for a wishful number of attempt. Shrink the dimensions of your X-Wing, or reduce your velocity if you find it too tough.

Tip 1: remember that X-Wings are wider than they are tall. 
Tip 2: don't forget to fire your proton torpedoes once your distance display reads zero.

Play & relive the vintage arcade games era.
